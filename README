This takes the decNumber C library and packages it up using the GNU autotools
so that they are easily installed on any machine.  I have no association with
the author of decNumber and I have not communicated with him.  Any errors in the
packaging are mine and should be reported to me at omari@smileystation.com.
Use at your own risk.

decNumber must be configured at compile time with the endianness of the target
machine.  By default, the autotools packaging that I have added will detect the
endianness of the build machine and configure decNumber accordingly.  To
override this detection, add

CPPFLAGS=-DDECLITEND=1

at the end of your ./configure command to make the library build for little
endian.  Replace the 1 with a 0 for big endian.

decNumber is available from

http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumber.html

This packaging is available from

http://www.github.com/massysett/decnumber

If you get the files straight from Github, you will need to have autoconf,
automake, and libtool installed on your system.  Then you run

autoreconf --install

in the root directory, and then you can ./configure as usual.
